    "## Specifications\n",
    "per step (independent of agents action) the fruit goes lower in the screen by the same amount (jump to next higher $y$ coordinate). There is always one fruit present (sometimes it can't be seen since it is under the screen one step.)\n",

    "## Task solved criterium \n",
    "### Old idea\n",
    "The variable steps_per_episode sets the maximal reward pro episode,  as $max\\_score = \\frac{steps\\_per\\_episode}{5}$.\n",
    "If the average cumulative score (reward) of the last $n$ episodes is $\\geq max\\_score*0.95$ the task is solved (this can and should be treated as a hyperparameter). As a first test $n=500$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current idea\n",
    "Train for $n$ steps independent of results. With $n_q$ for Quantum and $n_c$ for classic experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simplifications regarding Catcher\n",
    "* Discretization of $x,y$ coordinate of fruit and catcher. $3$ lanes, positions, for $x$ and $5$ for the $y$ coordinate. This $3$ and $5$ can be changed to add complexity (in the original environment these numbers would be the pixel width and height of the game window).\n",
    "* Velocity was dropped, to have $3$ inputs and outputs, since because of discretization it becomes constant.\n",
    "* No pause between fruits, normally the fruits appear at random times, although maximal one fruit is present at once.\n",
    "* Starting live still set to $3$ as a simplification to actual situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These simplifications can be undone  step by step to add complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results of first tests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configurations (a selection)\n",
    "\n",
    "For training $steps\\_per\\_episode=250$ then $max\\_score = 50$ and $steps\\_per\\_episode=1000$ then $max\\_score = 200$ for testing.\n",
